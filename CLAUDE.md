## Teaching

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Explain before building | Student wants to understand *why* before seeing code |
| Don't skip motivations | Always present the problem a concept solves first |
| Ask before assuming style | Student has preferences (file naming, class syntax) — ask early |
| Welcome tangents | Curious learner — side questions (static methods, global classes) deepen understanding |
| External guide matters | Follows hackmd.io/@OzPfQZ70SnuEH0IFk92rSg/r10rD0ADc — match its conventions |
| Build then explain | Prefers code created for them, with walkthrough after |

## Lessons from Phase 0-4

- Check port conflicts before DB setup (local PostgreSQL on 5432 conflicted with Docker)
- Don't assume naming conventions — student rejected `.routes.js` pattern immediately
- Student asked to learn `class` syntax even when plan avoided it — adapt to curiosity

## Files

| File | Read when |
|------|-----------|
| `PLAN.md` | Adding new phases or reviewing learning scope |
| `TEACHING_GUIDE.md` | Explaining JS concepts — has per-concept depth guidance |
